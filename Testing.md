# CARLA Planning Testing Guidelines

Make sure all code is reachable
Test if code works as expected by:
    1) testing on multiple towns
    Use multiple set of reusable waypoints to test program
    2) comparing outcomes to predictions
    3) drawing a line throughout the path taken
Verify that the car adheres to traffic laws
Evaluate performance under various traffic conditions (light, moderate, heavy rain)
